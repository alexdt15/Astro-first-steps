    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>
      I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
      page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
    </p>

    <p>
      This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
      back and see how my journey is going!
    </p>
    <p>These are some facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is {firstName}</li>
      <li>I live in {country} and I work as a {occupation}</li>
      {
        hobbies.length >= 2 && (
          <li>
            Two of my hobbies are {hobbies[0]} and {hobbies[1]}
          </li>
        )
      }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
    {happy && <p>I'm so happy to be learning Astro!</p>}
    {finished && <p>üßë‚ÄçüöÄI've finished the tutorial!</p>}
    {
      goal === 3 ? (
        <p>My goal is to finish this in 3 days!</p>
      ) : (
        <p>I'll be taking my time üòä</p>
      )
    }
  </div>
